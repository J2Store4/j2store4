**Important Announcement: Sunsetting J2Store Development**

Dear J2Store Community,

We have always strived to deliver quality eCommerce solutions through J2Store, and we deeply appreciate the trust and support you have shown us over the years. However, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to sunset the development of J2Store and its associated extensions.

This decision has not come easily. The rising costs of development, combined with dwindling revenue, have made it increasingly challenging for us to continue offering the level of support and innovation that our users deserve. As a result, we have chosen to make the J2Store project available as open-source software.

**What this means for you:**
- The J2Store repository is now archived, and the project will no longer be actively maintained.
- All open issues in the repositoryhas are closed.
- While we will no longer provide support or updates, the code will remain available for the community to explore, fork, and build upon.

**Extensions:**
If you have purchased a license for any paid extensions, you will continue to receive support until your license expires, which is one year from the date of your purchase.

We want to thank everyone who has been a part of the J2Store journey—your feedback, contributions, and enthusiasm have been invaluable.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We hope that by open-sourcing the project, J2Store can continue to live on in new and exciting ways.

Sincerely,  
The J2Store Team

## Free Software does not mean free-of-charge services

Our software is like a free spirit - it's all about the freedom to choose, not about being free of cost. Using our software doesn't mean we're tied at the hip or that you get VIP treatment. It's a no-strings-attached kind of deal. You're free to use it, and we're here to share it. Fair and square.

Kindly note that the word “Free” in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) designation of the software refers to freedom of choice, not lack of cost, as explained [by the Free Software Foundation itself](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html).  

Using our free of charge, FOSS software does not create any kind of business or other relationship between us, does not grant you any privileges and does not mean that we are obliged to offer any service level whatsoever free of charge.

You are free to choose whether you want to use our FOSS software and the resources we make available to you free of charge.  You are, however, not entitled to any privileges or special treatment just by merit of using our software.
